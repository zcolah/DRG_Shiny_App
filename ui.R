                       A Diagnosis Related Group is a statistical system of classifying any inpatient stay into groups for the purpose of payments. The DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses into more than 20 major body systems and subdivides them into almost 500 groups for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement.  
                       The data set we used in our investigation is a collection containing a summary for each of the top 100 DRGs for over 3000 hospitals in the United States of America that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System Payment paid under Medicare based on a rate per discharge using the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. These DRGs represent more than 7 million discharges or 60 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges. These summaries contain information about the total discharges, the average covered charges, the average total payments and the average Medicare payments made by the patients who have been discharged.
                       The values that we focused on were the total discharges (which describes how many people were released from the hospital), average covered charges (which describes how much insurance will pay for the treatment), average total payments (which describes how much the patient pays for treatment), and average Medicare payments (which describes how much Medicare will pay for the treatment)."),

A challenge that we faced was getting the latitude and longitude for each hospital. This was solved though the use of the `zipcode` package and using `left_join` to join the data with the zipcodes, latitude, and longitude to the data with the hospital information. A similar procedure was done for matching the population estimate for the year 2011 to each state."),
